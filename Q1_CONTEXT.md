## VMP Redesign / GTM Overlap

The UI/UX Release Support initiative is the support team's piece of the broader VMP Redesign GTM (owned by Ryan Schwartz on the CS side). Key coordination points:

**Shared context:**
- Beta launched Jan 20. GA target: March 31, 2026
- Feb 2 was the STOP DATE for onboarding new customers in old SalesHub
- New tier names: Core (was Basic), Plus (was Professional), Pro (was Enterprise)
- Transition period (now through Mar 31): photo-shoot-only onboardings, no software training

**Support's role in the GTM:**
- Beta bug triage, classification, and escalation to Product/Engineering
- Weekly bug summary reports for GTM stakeholders
- Zendesk tagging for beta issue tracking
- GA-ready Help Center content and support templates
- Known limitations documentation for beta environment

**When a beta user submits a support ticket:**
1. Classify: bug vs. confusion vs. feature request
2. Tag in Zendesk using beta tagging taxonomy
3. Bugs → escalate per critical bug protocol (Support → Product → Eng)
4. Confusion → check if Help Center article exists; if not, flag gap to Hannah
5. Feature request → log in feedback tracker

**Cross-functional partners for GTM (from Ryan's playbook):**
- Carolann Neale (CSM training lead for beta)
- Nathan Cooper (UX Designer — email specs, new UX/UI)
- Jim Lynch (Sr. Director Product — feature specs, go/no-go)
- Bob Williams (SVP Technology — beta environment)
- Paul Stutes (Sr. Engineering Manager — development, escalation target)
- Chelsea Mullin (VP Marketing — GTM strategy, comms)

**Enterprise accounts — special handling:**
- Hilton, Hyatt, Omni, Gaylord: Enterprise AMs own above-property communication
- William Barlow manages Omni (flagged "thin ice" but Kyle Bruner says relationship is fine)
- Enterprise accounts get "kick the tires" beta access, not forced migration
- Their current Visual Builder is NOT being removed

## Decision Trees

### "Which initiative should I prioritize?"
```
Is it a Must Do?
├─ YES → Is it blocking another Must Do?
│        ├─ YES → Do it first (e.g., Help Center blocks Zendesk AI)
│        └─ NO → Is the deadline within 2 weeks?
│                 ├─ YES → Prioritize now
│                 └─ NO → Schedule and track
└─ NO (Nice to Have) → Only if Must Do items are on track
```

### "How do I coach Hannah or Christian on a stuck initiative?"
1. Check the project doc for current status and blockers
2. Is it a capacity issue or a clarity issue?
   - Capacity: Can Claude take a sub-task? Check "Deployment Notes" in the project doc
   - Clarity: Does the initiative owner know what "done" looks like? Revisit deliverables
3. Is it blocked by an external dependency? Identify who owns the dependency and escalate

### "Customer asks about the new platform" (from GTM)
Use this messaging:
> "We're launching an exciting new platform experience in Q1. Rather than training you on our current system, we'll wait until the new platform is ready so you get the best experience from day one. In the meantime, let's focus on getting your content captured and your account set up for success."

### "Beta user reports a bug"
1. Classify: actual bug vs. confusion vs. missing feature vs. known limitation
2. Check known limitations document first
3. If new bug: tag in Zendesk with beta taxonomy, escalate per protocol
4. Log in Customer Feedback Sheet
5. Include in weekly bug summary report

## Workflows

### Generate Weekly Initiative Status Report
When asked to create a status update:
1. Pull current status from each project doc (fetch from Google Drive)
2. Organize by criticality tier (Must Do first, then Nice to Have)
3. For each initiative: owner, % complete, what happened this week, blockers, next steps
4. Flag any initiative that's fallen behind its deadline
5. Format for Slack or email as requested

### Draft Help Center Article
When asked to create Help Center content:
1. Check the [Help Center Setup doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qD9Jq5WsICQ_7Fp8ZXg6JiV8bBXdJxCbbdA_HTCROOs/edit) for taxonomy and style guide
2. Use product area categories: TrueTour, 360 Photos, CGI Renderings, Distribution/Channel Partners, Account Management
3. No old tier names (Basic/Professional/Enterprise) — use Core/Plus/Pro
4. No references to "SalesHub" or "TrueTour.app" in customer-facing content — use "Visiting Media Platform"
5. Include: clear title, problem statement, step-by-step resolution, related articles

### Create Support Training Documentation
When asked to build training materials:
1. Identify audience: internal team vs. customer-facing
2. Check cross-training skills matrix for current gaps
3. For internal docs: include Zendesk workflows, escalation paths, product-specific troubleshooting
4. For customer docs: align with Help Center taxonomy and style
5. Review against initiative project doc for scope alignment

### Coach on Initiative Project Management
When Lucas asks for help coaching Hannah or Christian:
1. Fetch the relevant initiative project doc
2. Check "Deployment Notes" section for what Claude can help with vs. what needs human judgment
3. Draft coaching questions focused on: blockers, clarity of next step, timeline risks
4. Suggest concrete next actions based on current status

## Deployment Model

Each initiative project doc includes a "Deployment Notes" section with a deployment class:
- **DO** — Claude can execute sub-tasks directly
- **COACH** — Claude drafts, researches, templates; human reviews and decides
- **PARK** — Parking lot items; Claude can organize and prep for future planning

When working on any initiative, check the deployment class first. For COACH items, always present drafts for review rather than finalizing independently.

## Terminology

| Old Term | New Term | Context |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Basic/Starter | Core | Product tier |
| Professional | Plus | Product tier |
| Enterprise | Pro | Product tier |
| SalesHub | Visiting Media Platform | Product name (customer-facing) |
| TrueTour.app | (avoid in customer comms) | Legacy URL |
| Visual Builder | (still valid for enterprise) | Enterprise tool — NOT being removed |
